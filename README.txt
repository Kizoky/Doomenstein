## Hell in Wolfenstein // Doomenstein ##

It's a mod that tries to port every Doom entity into the powerful Wolf3D engine, the ECWolf.
Very WIP.

Since ECWolf doesn't support folder dropping, you need to build the .pk3 file. This is the only way to load the mod.
Just run BUILD.bat, then you will see a "Doomenstein.PK3" file.
